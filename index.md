# Introduction
[Go to last section](#hopes-and-dreams)

**My name is Jinwoong Huh**
> I am a third year Computer Engineering student in University of California San Diego.

I am excited to be back in school again, after two gap years for mandatory military service in Korea.

It is fascinating that just a couple of years ago, I was only able to write code like this:
```
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}

```

~~I have some catching up to do, but~~ I hope this course marks a new beginning of my development journey. 

Please read the [README](README.md) if you'd like to know my favorite programming language!

# Hobbies
When I have time to kill, I like reading fictional novels on sites like [RoyalRoad](https://www.royalroad.com/home)

I also did [boxing](Boxing.jpg) for six years.
